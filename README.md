# 2D-InfiniteRunner
2D Infinite Runner Game Project designed for android mobile phones with Unity.

How to implement this project to your unity:
1 - install zip file
2 - unzip downloaded file to a new location
3 - open unity hub and select ADD from Projects tab.
4 - select project folder that unzipped and done!

I made the game endless simply just by using trigger and prefabs.
